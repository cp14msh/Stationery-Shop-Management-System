## 📈 Future Improvements

* **Data Persistence:** Implement a database (like SQLite) or file storage (JSON/CSV) to save inventory and sales data permanently.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Add more advanced input validation (e.g., prevent negative prices or quantities).
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Rebuild the application with a GUI framework such as `Tkinter` or `PyQt`.
